@leadlagreport Thx Joe Biden


@NORML Boy, I had such high hopes for both Obama and Biden on this issue and they never seemed to make it a priority. Embarrassing.


@goingaways @politvidchannel I guess Biden looking for someone to shake hands with, is normal.


This is a free speech test.  Biden was not legally elected as President, he is however a criminal.
