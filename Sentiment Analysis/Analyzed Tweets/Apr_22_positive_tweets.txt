@MonicaCrowley Watch the expression of the dude behind him. He is amused when Biden heads off in the weeds.


@LilChomskyX @QuakerProgress Biden: In the US Healthcare system every person is going to be covered for free. Everyone.


@IntlMergers @ScottWalker @CBP If Biden won’t I’m sure Trump will finish it when he’s President

@BillPegs Every ENEMY USA HAS and then some, are so HAPPY DEMENTIA JOE BIDEN is a illegitimate President.


@SenTedCruz Joe Biden cares about people, even you.


I really don’t care if Joe Biden is your personal savior. He’s doing a decent job.


@catturd2 #Biden is sending money because he thinks is buys support from Americans. He he really wanted to help he'd end it.


@elliekaysmith_ TFB! I’m sure they all cheered when #Biden shut down the #Keystone pipeline.  Karma really is a bitch, huh?


@OneFreshPillow Breaking in to celebrate the #Biden win? People were too busy dancing in the streets!


Have to agree with #Biden while #desantis is chasing a mouse. ⁦@GOP⁩ ⁦@TheFLGOP⁩ #MAGATS  https://t.co/v0nZrAebYv

Thanks #JoeBiden https://t.co/uwafm9DXxA


The #JoeBiden administration is outsourcing energy. #DemocratsTheEnemyfromWithin


#JoeBiden is clearly mentally unfit to hold the office of President of the United States.    This is an indisputable fact.


@GovRonDeSantis What DeSantis did was throw the Florida taxpayers under the bus to promote his dream of being POTUS.


@the_elite_dad @POTUS Hey dear. Kindly follow back and reply my dm ASAP. Thanks


@GovInslee @POTUS You're a climateloon. He's an IMBECILE, makes for a good laugh.


@POTUS We need prevention rather than strengthen trees


@POTUS Yes.  Let’s go folks keep feeding this monster.


Who’s going to warn the fires of the trees new found strength? https://t.co/M2AiPBywGm


Yeah We The People Are!! And so is The Real POTUS and The White Hats. https://t.co/rMp0bCMMn4


@ADCPerez46 @RoseMar95753967 @POTUS Great framing in that pic.


@POTUS Raise SS payments to medicaid recipients. Fund section 8 housing vouchers. Increase SNAP.


@POTUS And don't accuse anyone of being antidemocratic by supporting spending and tax cuts. This was John F. Kennedy's idea first.


@POTUS I am so relieved that you are leading us right now, Mr. President. Happy Earth Day!


@POTUS Awesome


@FoxNews @potus - you and @RepAOC ... scare-mongering to the D party.  The GOP is the party of intelligence and common sense.


@POTUS BRUH ARE YOU FUCKING JOKING


@POTUS You’re a joke
